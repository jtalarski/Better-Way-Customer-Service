## BestWay ~ Application Description
My application is called BestWay and is a humble attempt at building a Flask-powered web-app for a fictitious  cable
company, BetterWay. The idea for the program came to me after dealing with the cable company I was using in Minneapolis 
when I was trying to cancel my service. It was a horrible experience.

My program allows a customer to register an account, set up basic services, add optional viewing packages, and cancel 
or delete their account

## Prerequisites:
1. This program was written using Python 3.11
2. Packages required for the program to run can be installed via pip;
`pip install Flask Flask-Session Flask-SQLAlchemy Flask-WTF SQLAlchemy WTForms phonenumbers 
datetime email-validator`
3. I utilize the CDN version of the Bootstrap5 library for CSS styling. An internet connection is required 
to display the intended web page styling,
4. The Flask application is design to run automatically when the file bestway.py is run from the console or IDE.
5. Running this program will write two files to your local machine, bestway.sqlite3 and my_account_record.txt
